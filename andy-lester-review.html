<h3>A Review by Andy Lester</h3>

<p class="content">
I'm a sucker for practical instruction.  Theory's fun for a while, but
even in my geekiest moments, I'm usually trying to get something
accomplished.  I've read more than enough chapters on inheritance that
use shapes (&quot;squares have an is-a relationship with
polygons&quot;), or trivial web counter scripts that don't even
address file locking.  <i>Embedding Perl In HTML With Mason</i> is one
of the most practical books I've read in a while.
</p>

<p class="content">
Dave Rolsky and Ken Williams are two of the main developers of Mason,
a Perl-based web templating system that powers many web applications,
including RT, Bricolage and Alzabo, and sites like Stamps.com and Salon.
The book reflects the years of real-world applications that Mason has
been used for, and is aimed at the Perl programmer with sites to create.
</p>

<p class="content">
After a quick overview of Mason and its alternatives, such as Embperl
and HTML::Template, Rolsky and Williams assume that you know Perl already
and jump straight into Mason syntax.  From the beginning, there's great
emphasis on Mason's component structure and reusability across sites.
</p>

<p class="content">
Two chapters are standout examples.  &quot;Building A Mason Site&quot;
is a 50-page discussion of what went into building the <a
href="http://apprentice.perl.org">apprentice.perl.org</a> web site.
It explains design decisions and overview of the site, and gives
annotated code listings of selected components.  The "Recipes" chapter
is 30-page catch-all of various tools to perform common tasks like
authentication and database connection management.
</p>

<p class="content">
The Mason backend isn't ignored.  There are chapters on mod_perl and
CGI and when it's appropriate to use each.  I would have liked to see
a section specifically on performance tuning, but scalable design does
get its own chapter.  An Appendix provides a listing of the Mason API.
</p>

<p class="content">
So should you buy the book, if masonhq.com has extensive documentation?
If you're new to Mason, it's well worth your $35 to have a guided
introduction.  To the experienced Mason developer, there's still an
advantage to seeing Mason code written the way that the authors intended,
or learn a new idiom.  The book requires a Mason version 1.10 or higher,
so developers who cut their teeth on the older versions will probably
get something new, too.  The book does seem to collect and organize a
great deal of the conventional wisdom learned over the past three years
of Mason development.
