<h1>Foreword</h1><p class="content">
<a name="FOREWORD"></a>

</p>
<p class="content">
When Dave asked last year if I wanted to cowrite a book about Mason, I mused
over the idea for a few hours but ultimately declined. I&#39;ve already written
a good deal about Mason in documentation and articles and wouldn&#39;t want the
book to become a rehash of my particular point of view. On a more personal
level, the thought of creating any text longer than a few pages fills me with
trepidation. Given the choice of eight hours of backbreaking Perl coding or an
hour of writing, I&#39;d take the code any day.
</p>
<p class="content">
This book was authored, instead, by two Mason developers who have a fresh
perspective and who, apparently, like writing as well as coding. Dave and Ken
have been involved with Mason for years; they&#39;ve contributed to the project
immeasurably, first in discussions and later to the Mason core itself. I cannot
imagine two people better suited for this book.
</p>
<p class="content">
When authors have unfettered access to the CVS repository, as Dave and Ken do,
the writing process ends up shaping the product itself (e.g., &quot;I just
wrote about this feature but it turns out it doesn&#39;t exist--I&#39;m going
to implement it&quot; or &quot;I just wrote about this feature and it&#39;s
horrible, can we kill it?&quot;). As a result, Mason has grown over the past
year in ways I never would have predicted.
</p>
<p class="content">
Read <a href="chapter-12.html">Chapter 12</a>, for example, to see the new parsing/compiling infrastructure so insanely flexible that one can compile Mason into Embperl or replace Mason&#39;s syntax with an XML variant. (Consider the original parser, a single 371-line subroutine, and you get an idea of how far we&#39;ve come.)
</p>
<p class="content">
Or <a href="chapter-5.html">Chapter 5</a> to see how &quot;Calling Components with Content Blocks&quot; turns content filtering from a limited hack into a first-class language feature and opens the door to the creation of custom language tags.
</p>
<p class="content">
Or <a href="chapter-9.html">Chapter 9</a> to see how support for CGI (and its high-powered cousins FastCGI and SpeedyCGI) has gone from a few paragraphs in the FAQ to a full-fledged handler, inside a new modular architecture just begging for additional platforms.
</p>
<p class="content">
Such changes expand Mason&#39;s reach to an ever larger set of problems. At the
same time, the reference sections and copious recipes in this book help to
fulfill Mason&#39;s original mission: to provide a fun, simple, and powerful
environment for <code>mod_perl</code> development. Should we stray too far from this path, we will certainly hear of
it from the users.
</p>
<p class="content">
Reading this book has taught me a surprising number of techniques about a
product I used to know everything about and has reignited my enthusiasm for
building cool web applications. I hope it does the same for you.
